- ⚡ Fun facts: 
  - I played WoW for a long time with the nickname of Amondir, and almost every season that I play, I parse into top100 worldwide.
  - I discovered in 2021 that I have ADHD, and in 2022 that I'm an Autistic Person, and for not being medicated/diagnosed as child , I had to develop a list of habits and rules to make myself productive.
  - I rediscovered an old passion for Magic the Gathering, comming back to play EDH/Commander in 2022, and mostly of my decks can be found [here](https://archidekt.com/search/decks?orderBy=-createdAt&owner=Amondir&ownerexact=true)
